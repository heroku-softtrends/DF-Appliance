Heroku Enterprise: *used to generate large amounts of real-world data & send it to the IOT Cloud endpoint*\r\n2. IOT Cloud: *handles message ingestion, orchestration & business workflow for the 'Heroku IOT Demo App'*\r\n3. Heroku MQ (Message Queue) Add-On: *used to handle UX change responses from IOT Cloud to the Heroku App*\r\n4. ASP.NET Core: *language the Heroku App was written in (refer to [.NET Buildpack Support](http://www.dotnetbuildpacks.com))*\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/heroku-softtrends/DF-Appliance)\r\n\r\n**What to Expect Once Deployed**\r\n\r\n![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/herokumximages/heroku-appliance.png \"Heroku IOT Cloud In-Store Proximity Marketing\")\r\n\r\n1. Click *\"Start Sending Data\"* to begin sending *\"iBeacon Proximity\"* location data and display the Shopper's Loyalty Card\r\n2. To simulate the Shopper getting closer to the in-store Appliance Dept., drag the *\"Proximity to iBeacon\"* slider to the right\r\n3. Once you drag the slider to under 25 feet from the iBeacon device, you will see a Marketing Event fire and offer a Today-Only Discount\r\n4. To simulate the Shopper moving farther away from the in-store Appliance Dept., drag the *\"Proximity to iBeacon\"* slider to the left\r\n5. Once the slider is greater than 25 feet from the iBeacon, the Marketing event stops firing and returns to the Shopper's Loyalty Card\r\n\r\n**Support or Questions**\r\n\r\n* Contact [us](mailto:david@heroku.com) if you have any questions about this Dreamforce'16 IOT Cloud & Heroku Demo\r\n",
